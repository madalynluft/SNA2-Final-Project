# SNA2: Final Project

## Introduction
Good morning everyone.
        Today we will be looking at the study conducted by Michael Pearson and Lynn Michell called, “Smoke Rings: Social network analysis of friendship groups, smoking and drug-taking.” We will start by describing the original study by Pearson and Michell, which will be followed by an introduction to our own research question and findings.
        	The original study of Pearson and Michell was conducted in an effort to uncover how smoking and drug use in adolescence is associated with social position within peer group structures. A secondary school in West Scotland was chosen as the key community to study, as the students making up this school were a diverse population, which was important in order to generalize the final results of the study. 150 secondary second grade students were selected, and posed with a two-part questionnaire to fill out.
         	The first part of the questionnaire asked about the pupil’s lifestyle, family, self-esteem, smoking, alcohol, and drug use. The second part tasked the students with naming up to six best friends which would help the researchers in collecting the data used for the sociometric analysis. This second part allowed for the categorization of each adolescent as a group member, a group peripheral, or a relative isolate. It is important to note that when analyzing the second part of the questionnaire, the researchers based their conclusions only on reciprocated friendships because it is important to consider not just the existence of a friendship link but also the strength or closeness of that link as well.
	For the purpose of our study, we examined a subset of the original study, looked at 50 girls from the Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study data set. This excerpt was made for the purpose of illustration, in an effort to provide a small data set of dynamics of networks and behavior.
From this data subset, we narrowed in on the consumption of alcohol and smoking, and its relationality to group affiliations. We looked at both group structures, as well as the peripheral members of groups. Our curiosity has led us to developing our research question, “Does a person’s friendship group serve as a good predictor of whether they use tobacco substances?”
        	Based on our comprehension of Pearson and Michell’s work, we hypothesized that yes, an individuals’ friendship group affinity would serve as a good predictor of whether they use substances. As the study suggests, amongst teens, peers are likely to conform to that of what their peers are doing. Thus, we believe that through visual efforts, we will be able to see the ties of friendship groups and an individual’s relationship to substance use.

## Analysis
In investigating the data found in the study, it is apparent that our hypothesis is correct, the likelihood of a study participant smoking is closely related to their group affinity. Individuals were more likely to start smoking if their peers smoked as well and by the end of the third time period there is a clear distinction between groups of smokers and non-smokers. This reinforces our theory that risk taking behavior is influenced by one’s peers.
	The study included three distinct time periods where the social groups experienced a great number of changes. Within time period one, there are two clusters of smokers, both connected through nodes 1 and 10. There are also a few additional smokers scattered throughout the network, but they are not closely connected to the smoking social groups. It is likely that these individuals started smoking for reasons unrelated to their immediate peers.
	In the second time period, we see more occasional smokers which are linked to the smoking peer networks from period one. Disregarding some minor cleavages, the network looks largely similar to the first time period with additional smokers throughout the network. 
	In the third time period, significant cleavages occur and we are left with four separate friendship networks. Although there are smokers in each group, there is a heavy concentration within Groups A and B. These groups have very few non-smokers and include many regular smokers who were occasional or non-smokers in the prior time period.
	Of note is Group D, who have remained a largely cohesive group throughout all three time periods. None of the members within the group have smoked at any point in the study and only connected to smokers through node 34. This demonstrates that peer influence to choose not to smoke can also have an effect.
	This paper can demonstrate the influence of affiliation networks in the development of the peer networks among the nodes. Smoking can constitute a shared event or experience as participants are often engaged socially while consuming tobacco. The consolidation of most smokers together into Groups A and B by the conclusion of period three demonstrates the development of an affiliation network between these participants. Those non-smokers included in the groups may have chosen not to smoke but are likely to still engage in the social activities surrounding the consumption of tobacco.
