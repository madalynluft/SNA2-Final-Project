# SNA2: Final Project
### Madalyn, Madeline, & Ethan
## **Introduction**
The following report has been constructed around the study conducted by Michael Pearson and Lynn Michell called, “Smoke Rings: Social network analysis of friendship groups, smoking and drug-taking.” The original study study will be introduced and followed by an introduction to our own research question and findings.
		The original study of Pearson and Michell was conducted in an effort to uncover how smoking and drug use in adolescence is associated with social position within peer group structures. A secondary school in West Scotland was chosen as the key community to study, as the students making up this school were a diverse population, which was important in order to generalize the final results of the study. 150 students in their second year of secondary school were selected, and posed with a two-part questionnaire to fill out.
         	The first part of the questionnaire asked about the pupil’s lifestyle, family, self-esteem, smoking, alcohol, and drug use. The second part tasked the students with naming up to six best friends which would help the researchers in collecting the data used for the sociometric analysis. This second part allowed for the categorization of each adolescent as a group member, a group peripheral, or a relative isolate. It is important to note that when analyzing the second part of the questionnaire, the researchers based their conclusions only on reciprocated friendships because it is important to consider not just the existence of a friendship link but also the strength or closeness of that link as well.
	For the purpose of our study, we examined a subset of the original study, looked at 50 girls from the Teenage Friends and Lifestyle Study data set. This excerpt was made for the purpose of illustration, in an effort to provide a small data set of dynamics of networks and behavior.
From this data subset, we narrowed in on smoking, and its relationality to group affiliations. We looked at both group structures, as well as the peripheral members of groups. Our curiosity has led us to developing our research question, “Does a person’s friendship group serve as a good predictor of whether they use tobacco substances?”
        	Based on our comprehension of Pearson and Michell’s work, we hypothesized that yes, an individuals’ friendship group affinity would serve as a good predictor of whether they use substances. As the study suggests, amongst teens, peers are likely to conform to that of what their peers are doing. Thus, we believe that through visual efforts, we will be able to see the ties of friendship groups and an individual’s relationship to substance use.  
### **Research Question:**
Does a person’s friendship group serve as a good predictor of whether they use tobacco substances?

## **Data & Methods**
### Brief Data Summary
- Data collected across 3 time periods, beginning in the summer of 1995, with a year in between each time period
- Dataset includes 50 nodes/individuals, all adolescent girls
- Smoking level measured as 1 - none, 2 - occasional, or 3 - regular
- Six main social groups were identified that changed across the three time periods
- Data used: s50-network1.dat, s50-network2.dat, s50-network3.dat, s50-smoke.dat

### **Description of Methods**
Our data analysis was conducted using the NetworkX Python package in Google CoLab. The data used comes from data included in this repository, in addition to the dataset used in the original study. The first three data files used were s50-network1.dat,  s50-network2.dat, and s50-network3.dat. All data used can be found in this GitHub. First, the dataset containing the network in the first time period was loaded in. Then, this data was converted into a format readable by NetworkX. The nodes in this network were then relabeled as strings for ease of visualization later on. This process was repeated for the network in time period 2 and time period 3. Then, a function was defined for each of the three networks individually that allowed for the visualization of the networks. This allowed for the graphs to be visualized in an easy-to-read format. These individual network graphs were then annotated with differently-colored circles to visually indicate approximate group affiliations, and how they evolve across the different periods of time. The groups are labeled using Orange (O), Red (R), Yellow (Y), Green (G), Blue (B), and Pink (P)––See Figures 1, 3, and 5. Next, using the data contained in the file s50-smoke.dat, each node in each of the three networks was color-coded according to the corresponding numerical code in the data. “1” labeled a node’s smoking habits as ‘none,’ and was labeled with orange. “2” referred to ‘occasional’ smoking, and was labeled with green. “3” referred to ‘regular’ smoking, and was labeled with blue. See Figures 2, 4, and 6. The code used in this analysis can be found in the file named SNA_Final_Project.ipynb in this GitHub repository.

## **Analysis**
The study included three distinct time periods where the social groups experienced a great number of changes. In investigating the data found in the study, it appears that our hypothesis is correct, the likelihood of a pupil’s smoking habits increasing seems closely related to their group affinity. Individuals appear more likely to start smoking if their peers smoked as well and by the end of the third time period there is a distinction between groups of smokers and non-smokers. This reinforces our theory that risk taking behavior is influenced by one’s peers. For the following analysis, please refer to Figure 1-6 in the “Results” section.

### **Network in Time Period 1**
Within time period one, there are a total of 13 edges. The five nodes with the highest closeness centrality in this network in order are 10, 1, 6, 14, and 29. The five nodes with the highest degree centrality in this network, in order, are 10, 21, 6, 23, and 29. From these measures, we can conclude that nodes 10, 6, and 29 are clearly prominent in this network. There are two clusters of smokers, in groups R and O, that contain a lot of group overlap and are connected most clearly through nodes 6, 10, and 29, which follows from the centrality measures found. There are also a few additional smokers scattered throughout the network: node 7, node 40 in group G, and node 22 off of group P. However, they are not closely connected to these main smoking social groups, and are not connected to other smokers through their groups. It is possible that these individuals started smoking for reasons unrelated to their immediate peers. In total, there are 5 occasional smokers, and 7 regular smokers.

### **Network in Time Period 2**
In the second time period, there are 116 edges, and the social groups have become much more connected. The most notable changes are nodes 26 and 27 going from group O to group P, and nodes 14 and 15 moving to group O from group R, though those two groups remain the most interconnected of all. Otherwise, the network looks largely similar as far as group affiliation. The five nodes with the highest closeness centrality in this network in order are 18, 29, 35, 40, and 14, coming from groups O, R, and G. The five nodes with the highest degree centrality in this network, in order, are 16, 29, 45, 9, 18. From these measures, we can deduct that nodes 18 and 29 are significant in the network’s connectivity, which makes sense as they are important to the connectivity of O, R, and G, and 18 serves as a bridge to groups P, B, and Y.Generally, we see more occasional smokers which are linked to the smoking peer networks from period one. One notable change occurs with node 22, a regular smoker in all time periods––in period 1, this person is marginally connected to group P, a largely non-smoking group. In period 2, this person is now connected more to groups O and R, which are more smoker-heavy. Further, node 22 has formed new affiliations with node 18 and node 49. Both these nodes are now regular smokers, however in period one they were both non-smoking. In total, there are now 8 occasional smokers, and 9 regular smokers, an increase from the last time period. 

### **Network in Time Period 3**
In the third time period, there are 122 edges, and significant cleavages occur that split the network apart again, and most notably divides group P into two disconnected groups. There are smokers within each of the four main disconnected portions of the network. The five nodes with the highest closeness centrality in this network in order are 14, 32, 29, 35, and 40. The five nodes with the highest degree centrality in this network, in order, are 32, 9, 10, 14, and 35. From these measures, we can see that nodes 14, 32, and 35 are particularly significant. All three of these nodes are part of the mainly regular-smoker cluster composed mainly of group G and R members. The heaviest concentration of smokers are in groups O and R, as before. These groups have very few non-smokers and include many regular smokers who were occasional or non-smokers in the prior time period. Of note is Group Y, who have remained a largely cohesive group throughout all three time periods. None of the members within the group have smoked at any point in the study and only connected to smokers through node 34. This demonstrates that peer influence to choose not to smoke can also have an effect. In total, there are now 2 occasional smokers, and 17 regular smokers, an increase from the last time period. Two of the occasional smokers from period 2 remained occasional, two stopped smoking, and the rest became regular smokers. Only one of the regular smokers from period 2 stopped smoking––the rest remained regular smokers. 

## **Conclusion**
In this study, we analyzed a group of 50 female teens and how their smoking behavior changed across three time periods in relation to their group affiliation. This data serves as a demonstration of the influence of affiliation networks in the development of the peer networks among the nodes, as was elaborated in the paper “Analyzing Affiliation Networks” by Stephen P. Borgatti and Daniel S. Halgin. Smoking can constitute a shared event or experience as participants are often engaged socially while consuming tobacco. The consolidation of most smokers together into Groups O and R by the conclusion of period three demonstrates the development of an affiliation network between these participants. Those non-smokers included in the groups may have chosen not to smoke but are likely to still engage in the social activities surrounding the consumption of tobacco. Our initial research question was: “Does a person’s friendship group serve as a good predictor of whether they use tobacco substances?” Based on the information gleaned from this data, we conclude that friendship group affiliation and tobacco usage appear to be closely linked and reciprocally influential––students that smoke tend to associate with other smokers, and students that are a part of smoker-heavy groups appear more likely to start smoking or smoke more heavily.

## **Limitations to Consider for Future Studies**
While the networks that have resulted from our analysis contain compelling results, there are limitations to our study that should be considered for future research. The dataset used was a subset of a larger study, which looked at more variables than that of friendship affiliations and tobacco usage. These variables included elements such as lifestyle, family, self-esteem, alcohol, and drug use. Thus, for future research, it would be of particular interest to consider these other factors when mapping exterior influences on one’s tobacco use. Further, this subset narrowed its focus on 50 female students. With a small sample size in addition to looking at only one gender, results may not vary as much as they would have if examining a larger, more diverse set of pupils. It would be of interest for future studies to examine the role that gender plays in one’s tobacco intake, mapping out these interactions and their prospective influences. Over and above, while there are evidently limitations to the study, there are also great insights to gain from examining friendship affiliations’ relationship to tobacco consumption.
